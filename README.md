# My-SPT-AKI_personalMods
This is repository of my mod files which can be downloaded and copied directly to their corresponding folders in the location of your SPT folder.

The source code is found at the following link: https://www.sp-tarkov.com/ (current version: 3.6.1). 
I claim no ownership of the files and use this git project to showcase my mod selection and hopefully give someone else a better experience. 
Some of these mods allow tweaking the configuration files; this repo allows tracking the changes I personally make.

I made small to medium-sized changed to most aspects of the game which are accessible within the JavaScript SPT-AKI framework. I made no changed to the game's engine.

Tweaks include things like shop prices/availabilities, enemy behaviors, quests and progression, server modifiers/amplifiers, etc.
